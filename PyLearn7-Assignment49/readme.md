# MLP using TensorFlow

## Titanic ðŸš¢

In this challenge, predictive model is built that answers the question: what kind of people were more likely to survive?

## How to Install
Run following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Evaluation results:

|   |  train data  | test data |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Accuracy | 81 % | 94 % |

According to model prediction on Jack and Rose data, Jack won't survive but Rose will.

### Comparison of algorithms:

| Algorithm | Accuracy |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Perceptron | 95 % |
| MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) | 94 % |
